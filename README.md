CSS Grid for beginners

We know it's hard for students to have the full comprehension of gridding.
I tried to explain with my own words how things are done, because as I teach I can practice as well and have my skills improved.

If you want to make any changes, make sure you fork it first and than do all the changes on your side, or feel free to make a PR (pull request) so that I can see what changes you are committed to.
